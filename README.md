# SPACEXTYPER

## üìú Introduction

**SPACEXTYPER** is a fast-paced typing game created to blend the excitement of classic arcade shooters like [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) with the speed and challenge of typing games like [TypeRacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeRacer). Developed by a team of high school students, the game is designed to improve typing skills while providing a fun and engaging experience.

Inspired by the retro aesthetic of space shooters and the competitive nature of typing races, SPACEXTYPER was developed as part of a project-based learning initiative during Grade 12. The project combines our love for old-school gaming with the practical application of programming and game design principles.

The goal of **SPACEXTYPER** is to create a unique typing-based gameplay experience that challenges players to type quickly and accurately while dodging obstacles and shooting enemies. Whether you‚Äôre looking to improve your typing speed or relive the nostalgia of arcade games, SPACEXTYPER offers an exciting and educational way to have fun while you type.
